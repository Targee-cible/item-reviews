# FEC Conversation (Video)

During this project, you'll be recording two "conversational" videos that support your FEC Project. Below you can find instructions, constraints, and key takeaways. These are REQUIRED. Skipping the constraints will end you with a less-polished capacity for demonstrating your skills.

## General Guidelines and Overview

Follow these general instructions:

*   3-minute individual conversation
    *   3 minutes is ideal, but no more than 4 minutes max.
    *   Respect the time constraint. Aim for the minimum time, not the max time. Use the buffer time only if you really need it.
*   Focus on your own work, not your team's work.
    *   You should be able to describe the overall system your team is building in 2 sentences
    *   The description of the app should consume no more than 20 seconds.
    *   The event should feel conversational.
    *   Do not use a slide deck.
    *   A diagram is fine, but it must be shown on your computer.
*   A demo is NOT the focus (but could be present)
    *   You may show us your widget but do not make the focus of your talk a demo.
    *   Focus on an _interesting_ challenge you encountered or decision you made. **Please note**: For our purposes at this time, we define “interesting" as being a story about technical decisions that you made or challenges that you encountered which would be interesting to engineers and teams hiring engineers. These stories will probably revolve around _design, implementation, and optimization work_, and should ideally be justified with _quantitative evidence_.

## Preparing for Your Conversation

Create a new Google Doc for your FEC Video.

*   Identify 1 or 2 interesting decisions you made or challenges you encountered
*   Write several bullet points (up to 10 max), one line each, outlining your answer to the question.
*   Categorically analyze what is "interesting"
    *   E.g., choices around
        *   component architecture
        *   optimization decisions
        *   your debugging efforts
        *   … and how those decisions morphed under evolutionary pressure.
    *   Additional ideas for conversation centerpieces are listed below.

### Possible Conversation Centerpieces

Note: These are only suggestions. Do NOT incorporate them in a wooden, “check off the boxes”, or rote manner. Remember: "conversational" :)

*   What was your hardest challenge so far? Surely, something didn't work at first.
    *   What was it? Why couldn't you get it to work?
    *   How did I approach any bumps or unexpected delays? What problem-solving techniques did you bring to bear on this?
    *   Tell a "war story" with enough specifics that I, your engineering colleague, can visualize what was happening and understand the root cause.
*   Why did we choose to use (or not use) technology AB or C?
    *   The choice of state management is a good candidate for this.
    *   There may be other technologies that are specific to your app.
*   Ideas for technical topics you might consider:
    *   compare Travis v. Circle CI?
    *   compare client-side rendering v. server-side rendering? What did it take to setup/switch from one to the other?
    *   what are privacy & security concerns? what measures did you take?
    *   what kind of optimization did you do?
    *   what kind of best practice would you recommend for this type of development in the future?
    *   would you place limits on the # of files? file size? by module? for the overall page?
    *   what is the most important improvement you could make to your module for user experience at this point?
    *   How did they manage page load speed? or other aspects of the experience of the page load for the user?
    *   Is it a progressive web app?
    *   Did you make it mobile-friendly? using adaptive or responsive design?

## Record your video

Use your notes from the previous steps to record a conversational video.

*   Record your video using your computer's camera and microphone.
    *   Ensure your audio and video is clear: ideally you should be same distance you would be when using the computer while typing.
    *   Record your face -- we want to see you!
    *   If you have diagrams on a whiteboard, take a picture and load them onto your computer ahead of the recording, then present them by recording your screen. DO NOT attempt to record the whiteboard directly using your computer's camera.
        *   Remember - clear audio and video please!
    *   If you don't have a camera, get a loaner laptop from staff.
*   Upload your video to YouTube (set permissions to Unlisted)
